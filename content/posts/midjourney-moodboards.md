# Midjourney Introduces Moodboards: A Visual Thinker's Dream Tool

![Midjourney Moodboards](/posts/midjourney-moodboards/images/moodboard-main.jpg)

Midjourney has just unveiled Moodboards, a gift for those who think visually. If you've been collecting references on Pinterest, you can now do it directly within Midjourney. Upload up to 100 images, create your own "style profile," and generate outputs that capture the atmosphere of your board—essentially anchoring your creative vision and developing ideas around it.

## More Than Just Style Consistency

Moodboards aren't just about maintaining a consistent style; they solve numerous other challenges:

- **Visualizing Abstract Ideas**: Those vague concepts like "something between vintage and minimalism" transform into specific colors, shapes, and textures.
- **Clarifying Direction**: Particularly useful in team settings when everyone needs to be aligned on the same vision.
- **Preventing Creative Burnout**: References are always at hand, and Midjourney draws inspiration from what you personally consider important.

This approach is reminiscent of the old marketing days when teams would assemble large collages with photo snippets, text fragments, and key brand colors for branding or design projects. The difference now is that everything happens online and at a dramatically faster pace.

## Community Response

Twitter is flooded with results. Some users are creating stable styles for illustrations or anime, while others note that the "comic book" style still needs refinement.

One of the most interesting aspects is the ability to maintain multiple profiles for different projects and switch between them as needed. To "train" the model, you only need about 40 ratings instead of thousands—making the process quick and convenient.

## How Moodboards Differ from Style References

Moodboards and style references (--sref) are not the same thing:

- **Style References**: Offer more freedom and variability
- **Moodboards**: Focus on stability and simplicity

The feature even works with Niji, which is particularly valuable for those creating manga or anime-style artwork. Ultimately, this feels more like personalizing the model to your specific needs rather than using a classic, universal prompt.

## Sharing Limitations

Currently, you cannot share Moodboard profiles in Midjourney. The profile is created for your account and saved only for personal use. In the future, Midjourney might add the ability to exchange profiles or even publish them, similar to what happened with style settings and "style references."

## Future Potential

While I haven't tested it personally yet, I can see tremendous potential here. This is clearly a tool that accelerates and simplifies the creative process. It allows you to literally show Midjourney what's in your mind—and according to user feedback, it listens more attentively than ever before.
