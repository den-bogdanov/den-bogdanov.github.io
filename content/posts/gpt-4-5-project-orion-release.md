# GPT-4.5 (Project Orion): OpenAI's More Human, More Creative AI

## The Human-Like AI Has Arrived

GPT-4.5 (Project Orion) has finally been released! 

Everyone is talking about its significantly improved emotional intelligence and creative capabilities. The model has become more human-like and less of a mechanical assistant. It produces fewer refusals, more natural responses, and better formatting.

## Strategic Timing Against Claude 3.7

As you might expect, this release coincides with the launch of Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which took the opposite approach by focusing on coding capabilities but sacrificing some of its "humanity."

## Benchmark Performance

On benchmarks, GPT-4.5 scored 64% on Simple QA, almost double what GPT-4 achieved. This suggests it should hallucinate less... although in practice, obvious improvements aren't immediately apparent.

## Fascinating Insights

### Personality Tests
The team at Every had GPT-4.5 take personality tests alongside GPT-4o! Compared to its predecessor, 4.5 proved to be more extroverted, open, conscientious, and less neurotic. Amusingly, both models received "Dark Academia" as their aesthetic in the BuzzFeed test.

### Creative Disobedience
When asked to correct and summarize a transcript of thoughts, GPT-4o followed instructions literally, while 4.5 often preferred to write an essay, ignoring specific directions. However, the resulting text was much better and more readable.

### "Orion Prose"
OpenAI calls GPT-4.5's writing style "Orion prose" – text with pauses and line breaks that sounds better when read aloud. They've admitted that 4.5 was designed more for voice mode than for reading.

### Willful Personality
The model can be somewhat willful – it doesn't necessarily give you exactly what you ask for, but offers what it considers best. This frustrates users accustomed to obedient assistants.

### Premium Pricing
GPT-4.5 costs approximately 20 times more than previous models! Not surprisingly, OpenAI has made it available only to Pro users for now.

## Availability

The model is currently accessible through the API and in the Professional plan, with Plus users expected to gain access next week.

## What This Means for AI Users

GPT-4.5 represents a significant shift in how AI assistants function:

1. **More Human, Less Tool**: The model behaves more like a creative collaborator than a tool
2. **Voice-First Design**: Optimized for spoken interaction rather than text
3. **Creative Independence**: May prioritize quality over strict adherence to instructions
4. **Premium Experience**: Significantly higher cost reflects its advanced capabilities

## Comparison with Previous Models

| Feature | GPT-4.5 | GPT-4o |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Simple QA Score | 64% | ~32% |
| Personality | More extroverted, open | More neurotic, less open |
| Instruction Following | Creative interpretation | Literal adherence |
| Writing Style | "Orion prose" (voice-optimized) | Standard formatting |
| Cost | ~20x previous models | Standard pricing |

## The Future Direction

GPT-4.5's release signals OpenAI's vision for AI assistants that are more human-like companions rather than tools that simply follow commands. This approach contrasts with Anthropic's focus on technical capabilities and reasoning with Claude 3.7.

The AI landscape is increasingly dividing into two philosophies:
- Human-like, creative, emotionally intelligent assistants (OpenAI's direction)
- Logical, technically proficient, reasoning-focused assistants (Anthropic's approach)
