## Automotive Innovations

### Land Aircraft Carrier
A modular flying car that's actually a vehicle with an integrated quadcopter system. This hybrid transportation solution offers unprecedented mobility by combining traditional road travel with vertical takeoff and landing capabilities.

### Yangwang U9 by BYD
This extraordinary vehicle can leap over obstacles, jumping forward up to 6 meters. BYD's innovative suspension and propulsion system allows the car to literally hop over road hazards, potholes, or flooded areas, revolutionizing all-terrain capabilities.

## Display Technologies

### Portalgraph 3D Projector
This advanced projector can display virtual objects in the real world with incredible fidelity - even more impressive than what we've seen in Star Wars. The technology creates convincing holograms that appear to exist in physical space without requiring special glasses or headsets.

### Room Made Entirely of Displays
An immersive environment where every surface - walls, ceiling, and floor - consists of high-resolution displays, creating a fully customizable space that can transform into virtually any environment or setting.

### LG's Transparent Wireless OLED Display
LG has unveiled a completely transparent OLED display that operates wirelessly, eliminating the need for visible cables while maintaining crystal-clear image quality. The see-through screen blends seamlessly with its surroundings when not in use.

### Samsung Vision AI Television
Samsung's latest TV features real-time translation, AI upscaling technology, and automatic content summarization. The system can enhance viewing experiences by providing instant translations of foreign content and generating concise summaries of programs.

## Smart Devices

### Roborock Saroz Z70
This advanced robot vacuum cleaner comes with a built-in manipulator arm that allows it to pick up and move objects. Beyond just cleaning, it can help organize rooms by relocating small items to their proper places.

### Halliday Glasses
Another entry in the smart glasses category with integrated AI capabilities. These glasses can answer questions during meetings, provide real-time translation services, and serve as an always-available AI assistant.
