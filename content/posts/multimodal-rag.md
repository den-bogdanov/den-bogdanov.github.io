# How Multimodal RAG Works: Bridging Text and Visual Data

![Multimodal RAG](/posts/multimodal-rag/images/multimodal-rag.jpg)

Multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) represents a significant advancement in AI systems, enabling them to work with real-world documents that combine text with images, tables, and graphs - just like the documents we use every day.

## The Core Components

At the heart of multimodal RAG is a multimodal language model capable of simultaneously understanding both text and images. This model works in conjunction with two types of embedding models:

1. A text embedding model that converts textual information into vectors
2. An image embedding model (typically OpenAI's CLIP) that processes visual information

This creates two parallel data processing streams that can handle different types of information simultaneously.

## Vector Database Integration

All these vectors are stored in a specialized database - typically something like Qdrant. This database is designed to store and search for similar elements of both types, which is critical for the operation of the entire system.

## The Retrieval Process

When a question is received, the system searches for relevant information across all formats simultaneously. For example, if someone asks about sales performance, the system will find:

- Textual descriptions of sales trends
- The actual sales graph
- Potentially even tables with specific figures

All this information is collected into a unified context and passed to the LLM through a specially crafted prompt.

## Enhanced Answer Generation

During the answer generation phase, the model doesn't simply quote the retrieved text - it analyzes graphs, attempts to understand diagrams, and compares data from tables. It can:

- Identify trends in a graph and connect them to textual descriptions
- Notice important details in technical diagrams
- Compare numbers from different sources

## Real-World Applications

This approach is particularly effective when working with:

- Technical documentation, where important information is often scattered between text and illustrations
- Presentations, where understanding graphs is essential to grasp the full meaning
- Research papers that combine complex text with data visualizations
- Financial reports that rely heavily on charts and tables

In essence, multimodal RAG provides a system that perceives information much like a human does - holistically, connecting visual and textual data into a coherent whole.
