# NotebookLM Adds Podcast Feature and Launches Business Version

## New "Pass a Note to Podcasters" Feature

NotebookLM has added an interesting "pass a note to podcasters" feature. This new capability significantly expands the platform's functionality and makes working with content even more flexible.

Now users can provide instructions before creating a podcast. This allows them to focus attention on specific topics or adjust the level of expertise to match the intended audience.

## Multitasking with Audio

Users can also listen to audio reviews while continuing to work in NotebookLM. This means they can make queries about their sources, get quotes, and explore relevant materials without interrupting the audio.

This multitasking capability substantially increases productivity when working with the platform, allowing users to simultaneously receive information through different perception channels.

## NotebookLM Business for Organizations

Google has also introduced NotebookLM Business — a new version of the service available through Google Workspace with enhanced features for businesses, universities, and other organizations.

Key features of the business version include:
- Enhanced data privacy and security
- Integration with corporate systems
- Advanced capabilities for team collaboration
- Special tools for educational institutions

More than 80,000 organizations are already using NotebookLM, indicating high demand for such solutions in the corporate sector.

## How to Access the Business Version

To access NotebookLM Business, you need to apply for participation in the pilot program. Google promises to provide additional information about general availability and pricing for NotebookLM Business later this year.
