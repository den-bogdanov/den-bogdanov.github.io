# Anthropic Introduces Clio: An Analytics System for Tracking Claude Usage

Anthropic has recently unveiled Clio, an innovative analytics system designed to track real-world usage of their AI assistant Claude, similar to Google Trends. What makes this system particularly noteworthy is its strong emphasis on preserving user privacy while still providing valuable insights.

## How Clio Works

The Clio system employs a sophisticated approach to analyze conversations with Claude while maintaining privacy:

1. **Attribute Extraction**: The system extracts key attributes from each conversation, including topic, message count, and language.
2. **Conversation Clustering**: Similar dialogues are automatically grouped together.
3. **Privacy-Preserving Descriptions**: Claude itself creates descriptions for each group, carefully removing any personal information.
4. **Hierarchical Organization**: Finally, the system builds a hierarchy for convenient analysis.

## Fascinating Usage Insights

The data collected by Clio has revealed some interesting patterns in how people use Claude:

More than 10% of all conversations with Claude are related to software development, making it the most common use case. Education follows at 7%, with business-related queries accounting for 6%.

Some of the more unexpected use cases include:

- Dream interpretation (surprisingly common!)
- Counting the letter "r" in the word "strawberry"
- Planning Dungeons & Dragons campaigns
- Crossword puzzle assistance (is this cheating?)
- Football match analysis
- Advice on preparing for natural disasters

## Security Improvements Through Analytics

The Clio system has also helped Anthropic identify and fix several interesting security bugs:

For example, they discovered that Claude would occasionally allow prohibited content when asked to translate it from one language to another. In another amusing case, the security system was flagging conversations about D&D combat statistics as potentially dangerous content! ðŸ˜…

## Privacy-First Approach

What sets Clio apart from many analytics systems is its commitment to user privacy. By having Claude itself generate anonymized descriptions of conversation clusters, Anthropic ensures that personal information is stripped away before any human analysis occurs.

This approach demonstrates how companies can gain valuable insights into product usage while still respecting user privacyâ€”a balance that's increasingly important in today's data-driven world.
