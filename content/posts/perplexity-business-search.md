## New Capabilities for Business Clients

Perplexity has introduced an important update for its business clients — internal corporate knowledge search. This feature allows users to simultaneously search for information in both their organization's files and on the internet, combining internal and external data sources in a single interface.

## Key Features of the New Tools

New Perplexity capabilities include:

- **File Upload and Storage** — supporting various formats:
  - PDF
  - TXT
  - CSV
  - XLSX
  - PPTX
  - DOCX

- **Combined Search** — ability to search for information simultaneously in uploaded files and on the internet

- **AI Model Selection** — users can choose their preferred artificial intelligence model for processing queries

- **Customizable Instructions** — ability to set custom instructions to receive answers in the desired format

- **Collaboration** — feature to invite other users to work on shared projects

## Security and Future Updates

For corporate clients, Perplexity promises a high level of data security and confidentiality, which is critically important when working with internal company information.

In the near future, integration with Crunchbase and FactSet is planned for Enterprise Pro clients, which will expand analytics capabilities and access to business data.
